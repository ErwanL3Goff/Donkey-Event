AlloDonkeyCine
This website is a school project at Donkey School.
We are three students working on it, and we have two weeks to complete it.

Project Overview
The main goal is to allow users to make reservations for movies at a theater. We plan to add more features later, such as film suggestions or precise seat selection.

Technologies Used
We are starting from scratch, primarily using CSS, HTML, PHP, and MySQL. We may incorporate additional technologies if required (possibly JavaScript later if needed).

Features
User Authentication:
Users need to log in using either their email address or nickname and password.

Movie Reservations:
Once logged in, users can make reservations for movie sessions. They can make multiple reservations for their wife, children, parents, friends, etc.

Future Enhancements:

Payment Management:
We may add a page to manage payments or at least simulate one.

Session Linking:
A movie session is linked to a specific movie and cinema room.
